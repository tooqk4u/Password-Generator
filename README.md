Module 3 JavaScript

Project is created with the following programming languages:

HTML
CSS
Javascript

This project is a password generator that prompts the user to select the length of their password then select 1-4 types of characters to include. It then generates a randomised password in the specifed length with at least one of each criterias included in the password.

This challenge required using javascript to code a password generator. It required validation in 2 functions to ensure the user input was correct and if not to prompt the user to enter the requested information. This is where I learned NaN is a function in JavaScript. This was a difficult assignment and I ran into multiple issues with syntax as well as again messing up my repository by switching my files around. On the other hand I am getting very experienced with merge conflicts, git reverts and other tactics to fix repository mistakes. I wuld like to give creict to Phil Loy, my tutor for helping me find the simplest way to create this application. His assistance was invaluable.
